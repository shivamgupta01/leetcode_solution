'''
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Example 1:

Input: 11
Output: 3
Explanation: Integer 11 has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011 
Example 2:

Input: 128
Output: 1
Explanation: Integer 128 has binary representation 00000000000000000000000010000000
